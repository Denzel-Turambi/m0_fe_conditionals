# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    I feel pretty confident about my understanding with comparison operators, but my fluency is lacking, as I always have to look back at my notes to help me finish writing the code. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    Similar to comparison operators, I feel like that I have a decent understanding of logical operators, but I definitely need to spend more time memorizing which steps go after what. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    My confidence in if statements is pretty good as I feel like I have a good understanding of them. However, I do need to spend more time doing more if statements and getting faster at writing them.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    I think in total, I worked on this for a little over 2 hours. Initially I only planned for an hour and a half, but I underestimated this work. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    I need to practice the correct steps to write if statements, to the point where I have it as a muscle memory.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    I wonder how this will be used in actual projects. I should probably ask my coaches/teachers, and/or my friends who are software devs.
